Feature:
    I want to have the names of the movie files guessed automatically
    So that I don't have to type the name of each movie file
    And when I call an external service to get more information about the movie the web service search will be more accurate
    
    Scenario Outline: guessing the names of the movies based on their file names
        Given I have a directory that contains a file named <fileName>
        When I add that directory as a new media library
        Then <fileName> is added to the media library
        And the name of the movie is <movieName>
        Examples:
            |fileName               |movieName          |

    Scenario Outline: guessing movie names for some common file name patterns
        Given I have a directory that contains a file named <fileName>
        When I add that directory as a new media library
        Then <fileName> is added to the media library
        And the name of the movie is <movieName>
        Examples:
            |fileName                                                       |movieName              |
